                    <h3>Michael T.</h3>
                    <p class="story-role">Software Developer</p>
                    <p>"I was skeptical about investing at first. As a software developer, I started with just $200 a month from my first paycheck. The platform made it incredibly simple to understand market basics. After 18 months of consistent investing and learning through the app's educational resources, I've built a diverse portfolio worth $15,000. What really helped was the automatic investment feature - I set it and forgot about it, letting compound interest do its magic."</p>

                    <p class="story-role">Digital Marketing Specialist</p>
                    <p>"Fresh out of college with student loans, I thought investing was only for the wealthy. Starting with just $50 per week, I focused on ETFs and blue-chip stocks. The app's analysis tools helped me understand market trends, and I learned to make data-driven decisions. Two years later, I've paid off my loans and grown my investment account to $22,000. The best part? I did this while still enjoying my daily coffee runs!"</p>

                    <p class="story-role">Healthcare Professional</p>
                    <p>"Working long hospital shifts, I never had time to manage investments. This platform changed everything. During my breaks, I'd read their bite-sized investment lessons. Started investing $300 monthly from my salary into a mix of dividend stocks and growth companies. The mobile app made it easy to check my portfolio between shifts. After 3 years, I've accumulated $45,000 and the dividends are covering my monthly utility bills. It's amazing how consistent small investments can grow over time."</p>
